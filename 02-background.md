## Background 

The Internet has a long and storied history, but over the past few decades the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (`HTTP`) has remained one of the most popular transports for data communication.
`HTTP` (as well as the SSL-encrypted variant `HTTPS`, for that matter) is the protocol that most web servers and browsers use to send data back and forth.
When a browser makes an HTTP GET request to a web server, the web server then sends a response to the request, typically in the form of markup, scripts, stylesheets, and images.
With the popularization of `AJAX` starting in 1999, this familiar approach to sending and retrieving data was used in the same manner.
